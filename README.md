Eric i think we should set up the storing of products as Maps like Map(Category, List(Prodct)) based on the categories
for that store. It will allow us to debug easier if needed. 

Also should change the store constructor to prevent name typos like "Save On Foods" vs "SaveOnFoods" vs "SaveOnFood"

Future tasks: 

  - make the products and add it to the stores
  - add more stores?
  - be able to change location
  - make a price comparator
