Eric i think we should set up the storing of products as Maps like Map(Category, List(Prodct)) based on the categories
for that store. It will allow us to debug easier if needed. 

Also should change the store constructor to prevent name typos like "Save On Foods" vs "SaveOnFoods" vs "SaveOnFood"

We should focus on the biggest grpcery stores first. also the reason why superstore and nofrills have the same website
is cuz they are subsidaries of loblaws. i suspect that there are more stores that will have the same website as each other.
later we can pick like 5-10 of the most popular stores and we would cover probably 80%+ of all the groceries in canada. Might not want to put too much focus on thrifty's as it's like the smallest store.
